## Development

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.


### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

#### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

#### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```

#### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

npm run test:unit
```
